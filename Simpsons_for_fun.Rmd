Let's explore a dataset on The Simpsons, the [longest-running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons), and in my opinion best, American TV sitcom of all time. This dataset is available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data)

# Import Data
The dataset is composed of 4 files. Let's import them and have a look. 

```{r}
#import the 4 csv files composing the data
#first attempt at this led to some parsing errors
#so using excel I removed all commas from cells in the 'episodes' and 'script_lines' files

#records every character with a unique id
simp.characters <- read.csv(file = "data/simpsons_characters.csv") 

#contains data on each episode
simp.episodes <- read.csv(file = "data/simpsons_episodes2.csv") 

#contains data on locations in the show
simp.location <- read.csv(file = "data/simpsons_locations.csv") 

#contains the script of each episode and who is speaking
simp.words <- read.csv(file = "data/simpsons_script_lines2.csv") 

#show data for the two smallest tables
head(simp.characters)
head(simp.location)
```

The first two data tables are simple. The first gives a code to each *character* in the series and the second gives a code to each *location*. The next table is more extensive. It contains data for each *episode* of the show, including things like air date, season, views, imdb ratings, etc.

```{r}
#show episode-level data
head(simp.episodes)
```

The fourth data table is the main one. It contains the *words spoken* by each character during different episodes. The table is pretty large, containing over 158,000 rows!

```{r}
#show main data
head(simp.words)
dim(simp.words) #dimensions of main data
```

# Wrangle Data
We need to wrangle these four data frames into a tidy format for analysis. We'll start by picking the columns we need from each dataset. Here's a simplified *episodes* table.

```{r}
#select necessary columns in each of 4 dataframes
simp.characters <- select(simp.characters, -name)
simp.location <- select(simp.location, -name)
simp.episodes <- select(simp.episodes, -production_code, -image_url, -video_url)
simp.words <- select(simp.words, id, episode_id, number, speaking_line, character_id,
                     location_id, normalized_text, word_count)
head(simp.episodes)
```

Next, let's check the class of each column in the data tables to make sure they were imported correctly.

```{r}
#check class of each column
sapply(simp.characters, class)
sapply(simp.location, class)
```

The *character* and *location* data tables look reasonable. Both character and location names are recognized as character vectors for example.

```{r}
sapply(simp.episodes, class) 
```

We can spot a problem in the *episodes* data frame though. Air date was recognized as a character vector and not a date. We can use functions in the **lubridate** package to convert the variable into a date and then extract some useful variables like the year and month the episode first aired.

```{r}
#the variable is in month-day-year format, so use the 'mdy' function to convert it to a date
simp.episodes$original_air_date <- mdy(simp.episodes$original_air_date) 

#extract the month and year of each episode and make new variables
simp.episodes$air_year <- year(simp.episodes$original_air_date)
simp.episodes$air_month <- month(simp.episodes$original_air_date)
head(select(simp.episodes, original_air_date, air_month, air_year))
```

Let's turn our attention to the variables in the main table with the *script* data.

```{r}
sapply(simp.words, class)
```

One obvious problem is that the 'word_count' variable is a character when it should be an integer. We can examine the rows where 'word count' does not start with a digit.

```{r}
#subset data to show cases where word_count does not start with digit 
filter(simp.words, grepl('\\D', word_count))
```

Yikes! Some entries have logicals whereas a few others have text. This looks like a problem with parsing the dataset when it was imported. In fact, this seems to be a known issue with the dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/forums/f/1600/the-simpsons-by-the-data/t/24334/import-problem](https://www.kaggle.com/forums/f/1600/the-simpsons-by-the-data/t/24334/import-problem). Fortunately, only 15 of 158,000 rows are affected. Instead of expending energy diagnosing this problem and correcting the offending character strings, we will simply remove the suspicious rows and convert the variable into a numeric vector.

```{r}
#only take rows that start with digit
simp.words <- filter(simp.words, grepl('\\d', word_count))%>% 
  mutate(word_count = as.numeric(word_count)) #make it numeric
sapply(simp.words, class)
```

We subsetted the data to only include rows where 'word_count' starts with a digit. This actually removes many rows from the data, down to 132,000 from 158,000. The reason for this is that all non-speaking rows were removed, such as rows denoting a location onscreen while no one was speaking.

```{r}
dim(simp.words) #dimensions of simplified data
table(simp.words$speaking_line)
```

Before simplifying further, let's make a histogram of word_count.

```{r}
ggplot(simp.words, aes(x = word_count)) + geom_histogram()
```

Another problem! Almost all the values are small (a few words per speaking line), but the long x-axis suggests there must also be some extremely big values. It is extremely unlikely that one character had a dialog hundreds of thousands of words long, so presumably these are mistakes attributable to the parsing problems. Let's look at the subset of cases with more than 1000 words.

```{r}
filter(simp.words, word_count > 1000)
```

Eight cases come up. These are clearly mistakes, because the text has fewer words than is recorded in the word count variable. The very large values are likely 'id' values that slipped into the word count variable due to the parsing problems. Let's remove these values and remake our histogram.

```{r}
simp.words <- filter(simp.words, word_count < 1000)
ggplot(simp.words, aes(x = word_count)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

That looks better! The distribution is positively skewed. Most spoken parts are just a few words long, but there are some longer dialogs. We can zoom in on the tail of the distribution and see that it follows the same pattern.

```{r}
ggplot(simp.words, aes(x = word_count)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  xlim(c(40, 120))
```

This is looking good, but we want to make sure we have removed all the data that had parsing issues. One quality check is to re-calculate word count from the text variable and see if it matches up with the original value given in the word count variable. When we look at a few values for our recalculated word count, it looks like it matches the original word count data exactly. This suggests the spoken text variable and the word count variable are aligned correctly. 

```{r}
#recalculate words per spoken part
simp.words <- mutate(simp.words, words_recalc = 
                        unlist(lapply(strsplit(normalized_text, split = " "), length)))
#are original word counts are recalculated word counts congruent?
select(simp.words, word_count, words_recalc)[1:10,] 
```

However, when we plot the original and the recalculated word counts, we see some cases along the bottom of the y-axis where there is divergence.

```{r}
#plot word_count versus recalculated word count to see if they fall on a straight line
ggplot(simp.words, aes(x = word_count, y = words_recalc)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
```

46 values have this problem, and when we look at them we see that the text is missing. 

```{r}
#look at cases where original word counts and recalculated word counts differ
filter(simp.words, word_count != words_recalc)%>%
  select(episode_id, character_id, normalized_text, word_count, words_recalc)
#remove the cases where they differ
simp.words <- filter(simp.words, word_count == words_recalc)
```

Again, let's remove them. It is worth noticing that these problematic cases are from different episodes and involve different characters. So by removing these cases we are presumably not unintentionally introducing bias into the data.

Now that we are more confident in the quality of our main data, we can reduce the size of this data frame. I think a logical approach is to calculate the number of words spoken by each character in each episode. When we do that the data looks like this:

```{r}
#calculate total words spoken per character in each episode
simp.words.red <- group_by(simp.words, episode_id, character_id)%>%
  summarize(words_in_episode = sum(word_count))
head(simp.words.red)
```

Next we want to add the data from the *character* and *episode* tables into this data frame (we'll leave out the *location* data for now). Let's start by adding character names to the data.

```{r}
#create matching vector (mv) to add character data into main script dataset
mv <- match(simp.words.red$character_id, simp.characters$id)

#combine character data and main script data
combined.df <- cbind(ungroup(simp.words.red), simp.characters[mv,])
#remove redundant character id variable
combined.df <- select(combined.df, -id)
head(combined.df)
```

Then we can add in the episode data.

```{r}
#same approach for combining datasets as in last chunk, this time for episode data
mv <- match(simp.words.red$episode_id, simp.episodes$id)
combined.df <- cbind(combined.df, simp.episodes[mv,])
combined.df <- select(combined.df, -id)
rownames(combined.df) <- 1:dim(combined.df)[1]
rm(mv)
head(combined.df)
```

This looks like a tidy dataset we can work with!

# Who speaks the most?

Now we can ask questions with the data, and we will start with a simple one: who has spoken the most in the series? To start, we can look at the distribution of our words per episode variable.

```{r}
ggplot(combined.df, aes(x = words_in_episode)) + geom_histogram(binwidth= 10)
summary(combined.df$words_in_episode)
```

Most characters have just a few lines per episode whereas others have many lines. The median is just 19 words per episode, but the max is over 1000. This make sense. The core protagonists in any given episode are likely to have many lines whereas peripheral characters may only have a few lines.

To get a better feel for this, let's take 10 random characters and plot how much they speak per episode.

```{r}
#take a random sample of 10 Simpsons characters
set.seed(5)
rand.characters <- sample(x = unique(combined.df$normalized_name), size = 10)

#plot how much they speak per episode
ggplot(filter(combined.df, normalized_name %in% rand.characters),
       aes(x = normalized_name, y = words_in_episode)) + 
  geom_point() + coord_flip()
```

Even as a fan of the show, I have no idea who most of these characters are! Except for Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett starring as himself...
![Rock on](https://media.giphy.com/media/3orifeE8TqvAsAFpHW/giphy.gif)

Let's make a simple table of how many episodes each character appears in, and then plot the results.

```{r}
#table of number of episodes in which each character speaks 
episodes_per_character <- sort(table(combined.df$normalized_name), decreasing = TRUE)
#histogram of table
qplot(as.numeric(episodes_per_character), binwidth = 1)
```

Again a peculiar looking distribution! Most characters occur in very few episodes. When we zoom in on the distribution around 1, we see that over 5000 of the ~6700 characters in the data appear just once.

```{r}
qplot(as.numeric(episodes_per_character), binwidth = 1) + xlim(0, 5)
```

We can also look at the other side of the distribution, like the characters that occur in more than 50 episodes. The distribution looks a little discontinuous. There is a group of characters that occur in almost 600 episodes. 

```{r}
qplot(as.numeric(episodes_per_character), binwidth = 10) + xlim(50, 600)
```

As could be expected, this is the Simpsons nuclear family (Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa).

```{r}
#which characters occur in over 500 episodes
episodes_per_character[which(episodes_per_character>500)]
```

To get an idea of the variation in speaking roles per episode, let's plot the words spoken per episode for the 10 characters occurring in the most episodes

```{r}
#take the 10 characters occurring in the most episodes for plot
main.characters <- names(episodes_per_character)[1:10]

ggplot(filter(combined.df, normalized_name %in% main.characters),
       aes(y = normalized_name, x = words_in_episode)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
```

The character-specific distributions also seem right-skewed. There are a few episodes for each character where they speak more than normal. A boxplot is a better way to visualize this.

```{r}
ggplot(filter(combined.df, normalized_name %in% main.characters),
       aes(x = normalized_name, y = words_in_episode)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()
```

We should keep this skewed-distribution in mind in case we want to do any modeling in the future. A log transformation might be needed. We can also see in this plot that the Simpson family has more dialog than other characters.

So to come back to our question: who speaks the most? After exploring the episode-level data, we can expect that the Simpson family will dominate. Let's calculate the total number of words spoken by each character. We'll limit ourselves to the top 20 characters, because there are a lot of uninteresting minor characters in the dataset.

```{r}
#calculate total number of words spoken for each character, arrange data by words spoken
words_by_character <- group_by(combined.df, normalized_name)%>%
  summarize(total_words_spoken = sum(words_in_episode))%>%
  arrange(desc(total_words_spoken))

#create a factor variable with levels in correct order
words_by_character$character_name <- factor(words_by_character$normalized_name, 
                                            levels = rev(words_by_character$normalized_name))
#plot 20 characters with most spoken text
ggplot(words_by_character[1:20,], 
       aes(x = character_name, y = total_words_spoken)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + coord_flip()

#calculate and show proportion of total text in series spoken by each character
total_words <- sum(words_by_character$total_words_spoken)
cbind(name = words_by_character$normalized_name[1:20],
      prop_total_words = round(digits = 4, 
                               words_by_character$total_words_spoken[1:20] / total_words))
```

Homer has by far the most dialog followed by Marge, Bart, and Lisa. Of all the words spoken in the series, 21% have come from Homer. Together the Simpson family has spoken 47% of all words. After reading through the characters, it is clear that most are male. Let's add this element to the plot.

```{r}
#add gender to the data frame with the 'total words spoken' variable
mv <- match(words_by_character$normalized_name, combined.df$normalized_name)
words_by_character$gender <- combined.df$gender[mv]
rm(mv)

#re-plot but color bars by gender
ggplot(words_by_character[1:20,], 
       aes(x = character_name, y = total_words_spoken)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = gender), stat = 'identity') +
  coord_flip()
```

Only three of the top 20 characters are female! Two of those are Marge and Lisa. The only non-Simpson woman with a large number of speaking lines is Bart's teacher, Ms. Krabappel.

The most verbose non-Simpson is Mr. Burns, which is a little surprising, because he was not in the top 10 when we calculated the number of episodes each character appears in. We can check if some characters have a lot of speaking lines relative to the number of episodes they appear in. We willl limit ourselves to the top 30 characters.

```{r}
#combine episodes_per_character table with data frame containing total words spoken
mv <- match(words_by_character$normalized_name, names(episodes_per_character))
words_by_character$number_of_episodes <- as.numeric(episodes_per_character)[mv]

#plot the number of episodes vs total dialog for the 30 most important characters
ggplot(words_by_character[1:30,],
       aes(x = number_of_episodes, y = total_words_spoken)) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = character_name)) +
  scale_y_log10()
```

This is a little hard to read, because the character names overlap each other. Homer's dominance is still obvious, as he speaks more than we would expect, given the number of episodes he appears in. We can also see that Mr. Burns must talk a lot in the episodes he appears in. We can make this easier to read by zooming in on the show's secondary characters. 
```{r}
ggplot(words_by_character[1:30,],
       aes(x = number_of_episodes, y = total_words_spoken)) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(data = words_by_character[5:30,],
                  aes(label = character_name)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,400), ylim = c(3500,40000)) +
  scale_y_log10()
```

There are some interesting outliers. Mr. Burns must have relatively long dialogs. Sideshow Bob, a recurrent guest star, occurs in just a few episodes, but is clearly very important in those episodes. Some characters occur in a lot of episodes, but don't have much to say. For example, Lenny, Carl, and Barney (Homer's bar buddies) have little dialog relative to the number of episodes they appear in.
![Lenny and Carl](http://i.giphy.com/3o6Mb62MoNvu6ZnaDe.gif)

# Has character makeup changed over time?

So Homer has dominated dialog in the series, but has this always been the case? Let's see how speaking has changed over time for the ten characters with the most speaking parts.

```{r}
#note the 10 characters with the most dialog overall
main.characters <- words_by_character$normalized_name[1:10] 
#plot their dialog per episode over time
ggplot(filter(combined.df, normalized_name %in% main.characters),
       aes(x = original_air_date, y = words_in_episode, color = normalized_name)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(se=F)
```

It is hard to discern much from this plot other than Homer having the most dialog over the entire series. Maybe differences at the lower end of the spectrum will become clearer when we log transform the y-axis. We can also plot Simpsons and non-Simpsons separately.
```{r}
#only plot the Simpsons family
ggplot(filter(combined.df, normalized_name %in% main.characters[1:4]),
       aes(x = original_air_date, y = words_in_episode, color = normalized_name)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(se=F) + scale_y_log10()
#only plot non-Simpsons
ggplot(filter(combined.df, normalized_name %in% main.characters[5:10]),
       aes(x = original_air_date, y = words_in_episode, color = normalized_name)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(se=F) + scale_y_log10()
```

Now we can see that the screen time of some characters has changed. Bart looks like he was more important at the beginning of the series. The same can be said for Mr. Burns. Moe the bartender, by contrast, spoke less in early episodes. Instead of looking at differences between specific characters, we can just plot how the number of words spoken per character changes over the series. We'll do this for the top 30 characters (the plot looks similar if we chose a different number of characters). 

```{r}
#note the 30 characters with the most dialog overall
main.characters <- words_by_character$normalized_name[1:30]
#plot dialog per episode over time, pooling top characters together
ggplot(filter(combined.df, normalized_name %in% main.characters),
       aes(x = original_air_date, y = words_in_episode)) +
  geom_smooth(se=T) 
```

There is a noticeable decrease during the first few seasons. The Simpsons universe has expanded over the 20+ years of the series. If the number of characters increases, and there are more characters appearing per episode, then the time available for each character to speak has to decrease. When we plot the number of characters that speak per episode, then we see that it increases during the first few seasons. 

```{r}
#calculate number of characters that speak per episode
characters_per_episode <- group_by(combined.df, episode_id, original_air_date)%>%
  summarize(char_per_episode = n())
#plot it over time
ggplot(characters_per_episode,
       aes(x = original_air_date, y = char_per_episode)) +
  geom_smooth(se=T) 
```

So in the early years of the series, the dialog per episode for characters decreased, while at the same time the number of characters appearing in each episode increased. This dynamic suggests that different characters will compete with each other for screen time. At some level, this is inevitable, because an episode is only so long. We can examine if certain characters seem to compete for dialog. We have to rearrange the data so that each character is a column and each row is an episode, like this. 

```{r}
#put the data in long format; limit data to core Simpson family
episode_by_character_long <- filter(combined.df, 
                                    normalized_name %in% main.characters[1:4])%>%
  select(episode_id, normalized_name, words_in_episode)%>%
  spread(key = normalized_name, value = words_in_episode)

#remake variable names, replacing whitespace with underscore
names(episode_by_character_long) <- gsub(" ", "_", names(episode_by_character_long))

head(episode_by_character_long)
```

For simplicity, we'll only focus on the core Simpson family. Here's a correlation matrix showing how the 4 members of the Simpson family compete (or not) for dialog in each episode. 

```{r}
ggpairs(select(episode_by_character_long, -episode_id))
```

Two numbers attracted my attention. First, the correlation coefficient for Marge and Homer was positive (0.22), so Homer-heavy episodes are also Marge-heavy episodes. That's noteworthy because we expect negative correlations; the more one character talks, the less time other characters have to talk. The relationship between Bart and Homer, though, was negative (-0.32), so episodes tend to be either Bart-heavy or Homer-heavy, but not both.

We can test this with a multiple regression model.

```{r}
simp_model <- lm(homer_simpson ~ marge_simpson + bart_simpson + lisa_simpson,
          data = episode_by_character_long)
summary(simp_model)
```

The significant regression coefficients (positive for Marge, negative for Bart and Lisa) provides support for the idea that Homer often shares the screen with his wife but not with his kids.

# Who dominates in 'classic' episodes?

Any Simpsons fan knows that the quality of the show has not remained constant. This can be seen in IMDB ratings.

```{r}
ggplot(simp.episodes, aes(x = original_air_date, y = imdb_rating)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth()
#calculate mean IMDB rating pre and post 2000
simp.episodes$split_year_2000 <- "pre-2000"
simp.episodes$split_year_2000[which(simp.episodes$air_year>1999)] <- "post-2000"
with(simp.episodes, tapply(imdb_rating, split_year_2000, mean, na.rm=T))
```

In the late 90's the typical rating for an episode started decreasing. In the 90s the average user rating was 8.0, but post-2000 the average episode rating was 6.9. Here's a list of some of those 90s classics (rating of 9 and up).

```{r}
#the top rated episodes, having a IMDB rating over 8.9
filter(simp.episodes, imdb_rating > 8.9)%>%
  select(title, imdb_rating)%>%arrange(desc(imdb_rating))
```

IMDB ratings are based on user ratings, and some episodes have more user votes than others. Also, there is a positive correlation between user votes and user ratings. 

```{r}
ggplot(simp.episodes, aes(x = imdb_votes)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 100)
ggplot(simp.episodes, aes(x = imdb_votes, y = imdb_rating)) + geom_point()
with(simp.episodes, cor.test(imdb_votes, imdb_rating))
```

This correlation (0.78) is probably not cause for too much concern. It makes sense that people are more likely to rate episodes they like. However, because fewer people have expressed an opinion about lower rated episodes, the accuracy of these ratings might also be lower, which is something to keep in mind.

Let's see if any of the Simpsons family tends to have more dialog in highly-rated episodes.

```{r}
#plot dialog per episode against imdb_ratings for core Simpson family
ggplot(filter(combined.df, normalized_name %in% main.characters[1:4]),
       aes(x = imdb_rating, y = words_in_episode)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~normalized_name, scales = "free_y")
```

It looks like Bart and Lisa speak less in the highest-rated episodes. Homer might speak more. Let's concentrate on the classic episodes. We'll call the most highly rated 5% of episodes  classics and compare them to the rest of the series.

```{r}
#identify quantiles for top 5% of episodes
cut.pts <- quantile(simp.episodes$imdb_rating, probs = c(0, 0.95, 1), na.rm=T)

#create new factor variable
simp.episodes$imdb_cat <- cut(simp.episodes$imdb_rating, cut.pts)
simp.episodes$imdb_cat <- factor(simp.episodes$imdb_cat, labels = c("non-classic", "classic"))
rm(cut.pts)

#table of classic vs non-classic episodes
table(simp.episodes$imdb_cat) 
```

There are 30 classic episodes. Now let's compare the amount of dialog each character had in classic episodes to that in lower-rated episodes.

```{r}
#add classic vs non-classic discrete variable to main data
mv <- match(combined.df$episode_id, simp.episodes$id)
combined.df$imdb_cat <- simp.episodes$imdb_cat[mv]
rm(mv)

ggplot(filter(combined.df, normalized_name %in% main.characters[1:4], !is.na(imdb_cat)),
       aes(fill = imdb_cat, y = words_in_episode, x = normalized_name)) +
  geom_boxplot() 
```

Of the 4 Simpsons, the only one that has more dialog in classic vs non-classic episodes is Homer. However, there is a lot of variation and the difference is not that big. Maybe we can remove some of the variation when we look at relative dialog, i.e. the number of words spoken by a character as a proportion of the total words spoken in the episode.

```{r}
#calculate total number of words in episode
total_words_in_episode <- group_by(combined.df, episode_id)%>%
  summarize(total_words = sum(words_in_episode))

#add to main data table
combined.df$total_words_in_episode <- total_words_in_episode$total_words[
  match(combined.df$episode_id, total_words_in_episode$episode_id)]

#create variable for proportion of words in episode spoken by character
combined.df <- mutate(combined.df, proportion_dialog_per_episode = words_in_episode/total_words_in_episode)

#re-plot comparison of classic vs non-classic
ggplot(filter(combined.df, normalized_name %in% main.characters[1:4], !is.na(imdb_cat)),
       aes(fill = imdb_cat, y = proportion_dialog_per_episode, x = normalized_name)) +
  geom_boxplot() 
```

Using a relative measure of dialog does not change the plot much. Homer might be more prominent in classic episodes, relative to other Simpson family members, but not by a lot. 

We can fit a logistic regression to see if classic episodes differ in their character makeup than non-classics.

```{r}
#rearrange data for regression
logreg_data <- filter(combined.df, 
                      normalized_name %in% main.characters[1:4], !is.na(imdb_cat))%>%
  select(episode_id, imdb_cat, normalized_name, proportion_dialog_per_episode)%>%
  spread(key = normalized_name, value = proportion_dialog_per_episode)

#remake variable names, replacing whitespace with underscore
names(logreg_data) <- gsub(" ", "_", names(logreg_data))

#make dummy variable for whether an episode is or is not a classic
logreg_data$classic_dummy <- 0
logreg_data$classic_dummy[
  which(logreg_data$imdb_cat == "classic")] <- 1


#fit logistic regression
model_classic <- glm(classic_dummy ~ homer_simpson + marge_simpson +
                       bart_simpson + lisa_simpson,
                     data = logreg_data, family = "binomial")
summary(model_classic)
```

Two of the four regression coefficients are significant and they suggest that classic episodes are less likely to feature Lisa and Marge (sorry ladies). The coefficient for Bart is also negative. The only positive coefficient is for Homer, though it is not statistically significant. Homer averages 21% of the dialog in non-classic episodes versus 24% in classic episodes. The rest of the Simpson family combined (Marge, Bart, and Lisa) averages 26% of the dialog in non-classic episodes versus only 19% in classic episodes.

```{r}
with(logreg_data, tapply(homer_simpson, imdb_cat, mean, na.rm=T))
with(logreg_data, tapply(marge_simpson + bart_simpson + lisa_simpson, imdb_cat, mean, na.rm=T))

```

When we color data points on the IMDB ratings vs time plot, it is clear that all the classic episodes occured in the 90's during the series' 'Golden Age'. So what makes a classic episode might have more to do with 'zeitgeist' than how much screen time each character gets.

```{r}
ggplot(simp.episodes, aes(x = original_air_date, y = imdb_rating, color = imdb_cat)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Description One

The number of words spoken during the entire Simpsons series by the by 20 characters with the most dialog. Homer, by far, has had the most dialog (21% of the total), followed by the other core members of the Simpson family. Only three out of the top 20 characters are females.

```

### Description Two

Do characters share the screen or compete for lines? Episodes that have a lot of Homer dialog also have more Marge dialog, suggesting they tend to share the screen (Pearson correlation = 0.22). By contrast, Homer-heavy episodes are not likely to be Bart-heavy episodes and vice versa (Pearson correlation = -0.32).

```

### Description Three

What makes a classic episode? I considered classic episodes those with IMDB ratings in the top 5%. These classic episodes tend to feature slightly more Homer and slightly less Lisa, Bart, and Marge. Homer's share of the dialog is 24% in classic episodes versus 21% in a typical episode. By contrast, the rest of the Simpson family goes from 26% of the dialog in a normal episode down to 19% in a classic episode.

# Reflection

The Simpsons is the longest-running American sitcom ever, and with this dataset I have explored what has made it successful. The simple answer: Homer. Homer, the family patriarch, has had vastly more speaking lines than any other character. He is also the only member of the Simpson family that has had relatively more speaking lines in the mostly highly rated episodes. Homer has remained the main protagonist even as the quality of the series has declined, suggesting the mid 90's success of The Simpsons had more to do with 'zeitgeist' than with character composition.

Wrangling this data was not straightforward. The main problem was that the variables containing the script caused parsing errors upon import. Happily, this did not affect a huge number of rows, but this should eventually be corrected. 

I focused mostly on the core Simpson family. However, it would be interesting to look more closely at secondary characters. I found that some characters tend to have longer or shorter dialogs when they appear in episodes. Also, which of these secondary characters occur in the same episodes? Do they compete with each other for screen time? It would also be fun to go beyond word counts and look at the types of words spoken by each character. Homer has a well-known catchphrase, d'oh!. Could we come up with a way to identify the catchphrase of other characters?
