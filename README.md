# Exploring the Simpson's dataset

The Simpsons is the [longest-running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons), and in my opinion best, American TV sitcom of all time. The Simpsons dataset is available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data). 
This [blog](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/the-simpsons-by-the-data/
) provided some inspiration. My exploration of the dataset is summarized in the report [Simpsons_for_fun.md](Simpsons_for_fun.md). This was a project for a Udacity course and it was a lot of fun!
